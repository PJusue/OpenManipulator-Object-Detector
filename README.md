# OpenManipulator-Object-Detector
This is a project done by Pablo Jusue

# Description
This code allows the user to configure the manipulator to look for any objects near its
and take them if it is possible.

For doing that I have used the following materials.


# Materials

Raspberry Pi as a controller.
OpenCR board to control the OpenManipulator
Arduino Uno board to receive the data from the Liddar.
TFMini plus Liddar to detect the objects.

# How it works?
This code has been developed to work in distances less than 17 cm which is the maximun distance in which the arm can pick up an object. 

# How to load the code to the Arduino Uno board?
For uploading the code I have created another repository with all the information needed:
